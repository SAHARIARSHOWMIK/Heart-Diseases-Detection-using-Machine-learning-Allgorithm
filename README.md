### **Data Loading and Exploration**  
✔ The necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, have been imported.  
✔ A heart disease dataset has been loaded using Pandas.  
✔ Initial data exploration has been performed, including:  
   - Checking the shape of the dataset.  
   - Analyzing the distribution of the target variable.  
   - Identifying missing values.  
   - Visualizing feature correlations using a heatmap.  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has been conducted:  
   - Bar charts have been created to examine the relationship between age and heart condition.  
   - Scatter plots have been used to explore relationships between max heart rate, age, and cholesterol with heart disease.  
   - Seaborn’s pairplot has been applied to visualize interactions between multiple features.  

### **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**  
✔ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied to reduce dimensionality while preserving key information.  
✔ Data standardization has been performed before applying PCA for optimal results.  
✔ The covariance matrix has been computed, and eigenvectors and eigenvalues have been analyzed to assess feature importance.  
✔ Ten principal components have been selected based on explained variance.  
✔ The dataset has been visualized in a reduced 2D space using the first two principal components.  

### **Machine Learning Model Building and Evaluation**  
✔ The dataset has been split into training and testing sets.  
✔ Six different machine learning models have been implemented:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Decision Tree  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Naive Bayes  
✔ Hyperparameter tuning has been conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.  
✔ Each model has been trained on the training data and evaluated on the test set.  
✔ Training accuracy has been checked to detect overfitting.  
✔ Cross-validation (10-fold and 5-fold) has been performed to ensure model robustness.  
✔ Feature importance analysis has been conducted to determine which features contribute the most to heart disease prediction.  
✔ Model comparisons have been performed using:  
   - Accuracy and cross-validation scores.  
   - Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.  
   - Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores.  

### **Overall Summary**  
✔ A comprehensive analysis of the heart disease dataset has been conducted using data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning techniques.  
✔ The relationships between key health metrics and heart disease have been explored.  
✔ Predictive models have been developed and validated to ensure reliability.
